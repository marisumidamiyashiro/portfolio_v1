                <h1>FitTree Mobile App</h1>
                <p>FitTree is a fitness app that allows you to cultivate a virtual garden while offering users the option to subscribe and plant real trees worldwide. This app seamlessly integrates with your smartphone's fitness tracking capabilities to monitor your movements and step count during exercise. Users can nurture a virtual garden, with various plants reflecting the calories burned during their workout sessions. One of the app's key features is the subscription option, granting users the opportunity to have real trees planted globally on their behalf. The more a user exercises, the more trees they can plant!</p>

                        <h3>Project Brief</h3>
                        <p>As with any project, the initial step is to create a project brief to establish clear objectives and define the design direction. The primary challenge lay in developing an app that seamlessly combines fitness, gamification elements, and a subscription model without overwhelming the user.</p>

                        <h3>Style Tiles & Lo-Fi Wireframe</h3>
                        <p>Selecting colors to align with the overarching theme is crucial. Given that my app revolves around exercise and nature, I recognized the importance of incorporating abundant greens and browns into my design. After undergoing a preliminary design process, I concluded that a green-themed app would be the most suitable choice.</p>

                        <p>Establishing a solid base structure is equally vital to determine the required images and videos for crafting an optimal design. While working on the wireframes, I noticed a greater need for graphics than I had initially anticipated. This realization helped me prioritize tasks and avoid last-minute rushes to complete the mobile app.</p>

                    <div class="one-third">
                        <h3>Final Design</h3>
                        <p>In the end, I believe I achieved a cohesive design that enables users to easily navigate every section of the app. In the final design, I made significant changes to the navigation system. Instead of a side tab on your screen, it's now fixed at the bottom and accessible through a tree icon. Profile images now dominate the top portion of the screen and appear as circles when browsing your friends list. One of my biggest challenges was finding the right place for the FitTree video. After careful consideration, I decided to include it within the 'Learn More' section of the app because it's the ideal location for users who want to understand what FitTree is all about.</p>
